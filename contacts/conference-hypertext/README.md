# Conference HYPERTEXT

This dataset was collected during the ACM Hypertext 2009 conference, where the SocioPatterns project deployed the Live Social Semantics application. Conference attendees volunteered to wear radio badges that monitored their face-to-face proximity. The dataset published here represents the dynamical network of face-to-face proximity of ~110 conference attendees over about 2.5 days.
