# HGX data
Collection of datasets associated with the library [Hypergraphx](https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx) for higher-order network analysis in Python. 

## Sources

We collected several hypergraph datasets from different sources. The source of the data is acknowledged on the respective presentation page and we provide the BibTeX for a correct reference in your articles (please write us or provide a correction when needed). 

Most of the time, source data is naturally a hypergraph. However, sometimes hypergraphs need to be inferred from data stored as a collection of pairwise interactions. This operation is debatable and not trivial, therefore in this cases we also provide original pairwise data.
