# HGX data
Collection of datasets associated with the library [Hypergraphx](https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx) for higher-order network analysis in Python. 

We collected several hypergraph datasets from different sources. The source of the data is acknowledged on the respective presentation page and we provide the BibTeX for a correct reference in your articles (please write us or provide a correction when needed). 

Most of the time, source data is naturally a hypergraph. However, sometimes hypergraphs need to be inferred from data stored as a collection of pairwise interactions. This operation is debatable and not trivial, therefore in this cases we also provide original pairwise data.
